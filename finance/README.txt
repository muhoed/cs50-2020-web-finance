This is my more advanced implementation of CS50 Finance:
    package approach with dynamic application creation in 'application factory';
    all main groups of functionality are divided into blueprints;
    blueprints have their own resources, i.e. 'templates';
    handling SQLite database connection and other operations through Flask-SQLAlchemy extension;
    some small code tweaks and syntaxis mistakes correction compare to the simple version
